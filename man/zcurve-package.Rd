\title{zcurve: An Implementation of Z-Curves}
\description{
An implementation of z-curves - a method for estimating expected discovery 
    and replicability rates on the bases of test-statistics of published studies. The package 
    provides functions for fitting the new density and EM version 
    (Bartoš & Schimmack, 2020, <doi:10.31234/osf.io/urgtn>) as well as the original density 
    z-curve (Brunner & Schimmack, 2017, <doi:10.31219/osf.io/wr93f>). Furthermore, the package 
    provides summarizing and plotting functions for the fitted z-curve objects. See the 
    aforementioned articles for more information about the z-curves, expected discovery 
    and replicability rates, validation studies, and limitations.
