\title{zcurve: An Implementation of Z-curves}
\description{
An implementation of z-curves - a method for estimating expected discovery 
    and replicability rates on the bases of test-statistics of published studies. The package 
    provides functions for fitting the new density and EM version (Barto≈° & Schimmack, in 
    preparation) as well as the original density z-curve (Brunner & Schimmack, 2019). 
    Furthermore, the package provides summarizing and plotting functions for the 
    fitted z-curve objects. See the aforementioned articles for more information about 
    the z-curves, expected discovery and replicability rates, validation 
    studies, and limitations.
